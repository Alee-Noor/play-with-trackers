# play-with-trackers
A simple Single and Multi Object tracker system for drone espacially for Vehicles

# Simplified Motion Tracking App

This is a Python-based **object tracking application** that uses **YOLOv8** for object detection and supports two multi-object tracking (MOT) methods:
- **ByteTrack** (built into Ultralytics YOLO)
- **DeepSORT** (via [deep-sort-realtime](https://github.com/levan92/deep-sort-realtime))

Additionally, you can switch to **Single Object Tracking (SOT)** interactively with OpenCV trackers (**CSRT**, **KCF**, or **MOSSE**).  
The app also supports **video recording** with overlays and a **transparent info panel**.
